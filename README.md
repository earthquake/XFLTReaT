This is just one thing of many things that was missing from the Internet. If you got tired of trying several tunnelling tools for each protocols, this must be your ~~tool~~^W framework.

### Available modules ###

* TCP
* UDP
* ICMP
* SOCKS v4, 4a, 5
* HTTP CONNECT
* SCTP (by Darren Martyn @info_dox)
* WebSocket
* DNS (A/CNAME, PRIVATE, NULL) - Proof of Concept
* RDP (Windows only)

### TL;DR ###

If you want to: 
* get unrestricted Internet access from restricted networks
* exfiltrate data over a noisy side channel
* use a custom protocol to tunnel data
* etc.

Then this could be your ultimate tool.
